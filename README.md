# Heart_Attack_Prediction
-->Implementing Logistic Regression and SVM on a Dataset.

-->Exploratory Analysis, Visualization Techniques are performed before fitting the dataset into the models.

-->mean_squared_error and accuracy_score are calculated for both the models.

-->confusion_matrix for both the models are also created.

-->Since the value of mean_squared_error is less and the value of accuracy_score is more for the Logistic Regression Model than for the SVM Model,therefore Logistic Regression Model is more suitable than SVM Model for the given dataset.
